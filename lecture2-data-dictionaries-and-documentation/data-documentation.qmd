## Motivation {.smaller}

-   **We've learned a bit about:**
    -   [Git and GitHub]{.blue-bold} for code version control and management
    -   [Reproducible]{.blue-bold} data analysis workflows

<br>

-   **But have not discussed data dictionaries and their role in reproducible research**
    -   [Facilitate collaboration]{.blue-bold} with other researchers
    -   [Provide clear and detailed information]{.blue-bold} about the data being used
        -   Data sources and considerations
        -   Structure and format
        -   Variable definitions and interpretation of their values

## Learning objectives {.smaller}

-   **Understand the [importance of data dictionaries]{.blue-bold} for data analysis**
    -   Ensuring consistency of data, and how the data are used
    -   Facilitating research collaboration

::: {.small-break}
:::

-   **Learn about the [common components]{.blue-bold} of data dictionaries**
    -   Variable names and definitions
    -   Data types
    -   Value labels, and other attributes
    -   Missing data codes

::: {.small-break}
:::

-   **Discuss [creating and maintaining]{.blue-bold} data dictionaries**
    -   Well-described entries
    -   Keeping data dictionaries up-to date


## What are data dictionaries? {.smaller}

  -   **Data dictionaries**
      -   Provide key information and metadata about variables included in a dataset
      -   Serve as an important reference guide for data analysts
      -   The structure, format, and contents will vary depending on the project

::: {.small-break}
:::

-   **Core elements typically include**
    -   A description of the study or data source(s)
    -   Variable names, definitions (and units, where applicable)
    -   Data types
    -   Value labels
    -   Calculations performed (where applicable)
    -   Other details relevant to a specific project

## Dataset descriptions {.smaller}

::: {.small-break}
:::

-   [Dataset descriptions help to contextualize the data they contain]{.blue-bold}

::: {.small-break}
:::

-   **Descriptions should typically include**
    -   An overview of the project or data origins
      -   [Why]{.blue-bold} the data were collected
      -   [What]{.blue-bold} data was collected
      -   [Who]{.blue-bold} collected the data
      -   [When]{.blue-bold} the data were collected
      -   Data collection methodology and related considerations
          -   e.g., data quality issues
    -   Other details relevant for specific projects
          
## Variable entries {.smaller}

::: {.small-break}
:::

-   [Variable entries provide specific information pertaining to each variable in the data]{.blue-bold}
  
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

-   **Entries should include**
  -   Concise but descriptive variable names
      -   Accurately reflect the underlying data
  -   Detailed descriptions of what the variables are
  -   Data type
  -   Characteristics such as:
      -   Units
      -   Factor levels
      -   Range of values
      -   Transformations

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

  -   **You may also want to include:**
      -   Links to relevant documentation
      -   Notes on data quality issues
      -   Other relevant information helpful for use and interpretation
      -   Data type and format of the variable, including any missing data codes

## Examples of variable entries {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

[Bad Entry]{.blue-bold}   

-   **Variable Name:** Age
-   **Definition:** Age of participant
-   **Data Type:** Number
-   **Notes:** N/A
:::

<br>

::: {.incremental}
[Good Entry]{.blue-bold} 

-   **Variable Name:** Age 
-   **Definition:** The age of the patient at the time of the study, measured in years 
-   **Data Type:** Integer
-   **Notes:** Age data was collected via self-report on the baseline questionnaire and verified with a government-issued ID.

<br>

::: {.incremental}
[Good Entry]{.blue-bold}

-   **Variable Name:** Smoking status 
-   **Definition:** Whether or not the patient currently smokes cigarettes 
-   **Data Type:** Dichotomous (yes=1 | no=0)

## Common mistakes {.smaller}

-   **Insufficient detail**
    -   Inconsistent and poor variable naming conventions
    -   Imprecise or vague definitions
    -   Omission of pertinent information about data quality issues

::: {.smaller}
:::

-  **Inaccuracies**
    -   Failure to keep current with evolving research
    -   Discrepancies with the dataset
    
::: {.smaller}
:::

-   **Poor standardization and formatting** 
    -   Difficult for others to understand
    -   Inconsistencies make it difficult to maintain

## Discussion questions {.smaller}

<br>

-   **What do you look for in a data dictionary? What do you include?**

<br>

-   **Have you ever had a negative experience working with poorly documented data? **

<br>

-   **Do you follow a specific process when developing your own data dictionaries? **

## Key takeaways {.smaller}

::: {.small-break}
:::

-   **Data dictionaries are important tools in research**
    -   Provide a clear, standardized way of describing the data being used
		-   Ensure consistency in how data should be interpreted by investigators
		-   Overall, help to promote transparent and reproducible research!

::: {.small-break}
:::

-   **Data dictionaries should be detailed, consistent, and accurate**
    -   Include all variables relevant for data analysis and, for each, provide:
        -   Variable names
			  -   Detailed variable descriptions
			  -   Data types
			  -   Notes relevant to data collection procedures, calculations, etc.
			  -   Any other details that will help to interpret the data

## Key takeaways (cont.) {.smaller}

-   **Data dictionaries should be kept up to date over the course of a project**
    -   Include new and derived variables
    -   Document changes in data collection and/or analysis methods
