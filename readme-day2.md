### Homework: 

  - Read in a dataset of your choice [we will give you some example datasets you can use] and create a few figures using ggplot2. We want to see students include titles, subtitles, captions, data sources, legends, etc.
    - The figures should include one univariate figure, one bivariate figure, and one figure using facet_wrap or facet_grid
    - If you're feeling extra, have fun stylizing your plots!  Go wild!  Try to change up the background, fonts, etc. 

### Recommended materials: 
  
  - Our learnr tutorial on Conditionals, Control Flow, and Logic in R
  - *Smithsonian Data Management and Best Practices â€” Describing Your Data: Data Dictionaries*
    - <https://library.si.edu/sites/default/files/tutorial/pdf/datadictionaries20180226.pdf>
  - *U.S. Geological Survey, Data Dictionaries*
    - <https://www.usgs.gov/data-management/data-dictionaries>
  - Skim the readr cheatsheet: 
    - <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-import.pdf>
    - Keep in mind, your goal shouldn't be to memorize everything, but rather to 
      get a sense of what functionality is available to you, and how you could 
      reference this cheatsheet or follow up on its contents to make use of it.

Truly extra reading for those interested in advancing their conceptual understanding of ggplot2 and the possibilities in data visualization: 

  - *A Layered Grammar of Graphics, by Hadley Wickham* <http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf>
  - Start to get familiar with the ggplot2 book. We recommend starting with 
  subsection 1.2 "What is the grammar of graphics?" here: 
  <https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html#what-is-the-grammar-of-graphics>
  - The R Graph Gallery: <https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html>
  

What you can expect from the instructional team: 

  - We will be reading your bios and working on sorting you into groups for the final
  presentation topics.
